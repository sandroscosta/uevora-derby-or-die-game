# Derby or Die

The objetive of this game is to run away from EMEL, or else they will fine you for bad parking.
Hold on as long as you can. As you resist, you'll get more and more enemies spawning to block you.

## Mechanics

Use the arrows to drive the car. If the car gets hit, you'll lose health.

## Known issues

* The background is now the best at helping you to distinguish enemies
* Game restart sometimes doesn't work. Couldn't understand why
* The interface is weak and doesn't communicate all that well to the player what's happening

## Other notes

There's still a clear lack of knowledge (on my end) of how Godot works and that's why some of the bugs still presist.
All feedback is good feedback.
